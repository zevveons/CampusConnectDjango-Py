# CampusConnectDjango-Py
ðŸ“‚ Django and Python code for connecting students to clubs, events, and collegesðŸ§  

What does it prove?
âœ… Django framework proficiency â€“ Use of views, models, templates, and pagination.
âœ… Dynamic content rendering â€“ Data is pulled from models and displayed in templates using render_to_response.
âœ… Error handling â€“ Implementation of exception catching and Http404 for invalid data or missing objects.
âœ… Pagination â€“ Use of Django's Paginator to manage and display data in manageable chunks (3 per page).
âœ… Querying and filtering â€“ Shows ability to filter data by popularity, type, region, and foreign key relationships (e.g., club.college.id).
âœ… Separation of concerns â€“ Logic is kept in views, while display is handled by templates.

ðŸ§  Conceptual Understanding
âœ… Model-view-template (MVT) architecture â€“ Clear separation between logic, data, and presentation.
âœ… User navigation flow â€“ Supports exploration of different content types via filters (by region/type/popularity).
âœ… Data relationships â€“ Demonstrates understanding of model relationships (e.g., clubs and colleges, events and hosts).
